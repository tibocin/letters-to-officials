Dear [Official],

I am writing to bring to your attention the concerning situation of Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen and decorated law enforcement officer who has been wrongfully detained in Nigeria since February. As an advocate for justice and protection of American citizens abroad, I urge you to take action in this matter.

Tigran Gambaryan is a respected figure in the cryptocurrency industry, having previously served as an IRS investigator. His arrest came as a result of alleged crimes committed by his company, Binance, which has been met with skepticism from current and former agents who believe that the US government should be doing more to aid one of its own.

I implore you to use your influence to press for Mr. Gambaryan's immediate release and investigate the circumstances surrounding his detainment. As a concerned citizen, I am confident that your office will take appropriate measures to ensure that our citizens receive fair treatment abroad and that justice prevails in this case.

Thank you for your time and attention to this pressing matter. I eagerly await your response and action on this issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
